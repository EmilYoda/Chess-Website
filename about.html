        <p>
            This website was created as a university project and a tool for chess enthusiasts by 2 university students.
            Our goal was to create a decent chess website with functionality good enough for anyone to be able to use no matter 
            their chess level. However it might still lack the necessary AI to give better responses and analysis for more 
            experienced chess players, but the tools already implemented are more than enough for any beginner to learn on their own 
            and understand the basics of chess and improve as a player. We hope to bring better features in the future and gorw 
            our project.
