        <h1>The Bishop</h1>
        <p> 
            The bishop is an interesting piece because it can move as far as it wants but only on diagonals. It is a long-range 
            piece and can be very dangerous! 
            <br>
            The bishop is considered a minor piece (like a knight) and is worth three points. It is considerably more valuable 
            than a pawn (which is worth one point), equally valuable as a knight (also three points), but less valuable than a 
            rook (five points) or a queen (nine points).
        </p>
        <h2>How the Bishop moves:</h2>
        <p>
            The bishop is interesting because it never moves straight forward, backward or side to side. It cannot hop over other 
            pieces like a knight. The bishop moves only on diagonals.
        </p>

        <p>
            Every bishop is confined to half of the board, as it can move only on its respective light or dark squares. 
            A light-squared bishop can move only on light squares, while a dark-squared bishop can move only on dark squares. 
            The two bishops work well together if they are on adjacent diagonalsâ€”look how many squares these two bishops control!
