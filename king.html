        <h1>The King</h1>
        <p> 
            The king is not the most powerful chess piece, but it is the most important one! 
            If a king is put in checkmate, then the game is over! It's considered to not have 
            any points of value. Two very important aspects of the game of chess are attacking your 
            opponent's king while also keeping your own king safe and protected. The king is less 
            powerful than almost every chess piece, but it is also unique: the king is the only piece 
            that can never be captured! If a king is attacked, it is in "check".
            <br>
        </p>
        <h2>How the King moves:</h2>
        <img class="image" src="KingMoves1.png">
        <p>
            The red squares represent the possible squares the King can move to. Therefore the King 
            moves to all the squares around him.
            <br><br>
            When a king is attacked, it is in check. A king cannot move into check (that is considered 
            an illegal move), and if a king is put in check, it must get out of check. There are three 
            ways to get out of check: 1) move the king out of check, 2) block the check with another 
            piece and 3) capture the piece putting the king in check. If a king is in check and none of 
            these options are legal, then a checkmate has occurred and the game is over!
            <br><br>
            The picture bellow shows an example of a check on the King (not checkmate):
        </p>

        <p>
            Bellow is a checkmate example:
        </p>
        <img class="image" src="KingCheckmate.jpeg">
        <p>
            Black is unable to block or capture white's Queen and neither can they move their King to a safe 
            square therefore this is checkmate. 
        </p>
        <h2>Castling</h2>
        <p>
            Castling is a special move in chess where you do multiple unique actions. First of all, it is the 
            only move where you may move two pieces in the same move! Secondly, castling is the only time in 
            chess when it is legal to move the king more than one square! Third, it is the only move that both 
            develops your rook and protects your king. Castling can be performed on the kingside (notated as 0-0) 
            or queenside (notated as 0-0-0). 
            <br><br>
            Castling involves the king and a rook. As mentioned, there are many rules to castling: The first is 
            that you may only castle if you haven't moved your king and your rook (on the side where you want to castle). 
            The second rule is that no piece can be between your king and the rook on the side where you want to castle. 
            In the diagram below, we can see that nothing is between White's king on e1 and White's rook on h1.
        </p>
        <img class="image" src="Castling1.png">
        <p>
            Since there are no pieces in between the king and the rook and because neither piece has moved, White 
            can castle kingside! How do we do this? The white king moves two squares (from e1 to g1), and the white 
            rook moves from h1 to f1. Here is a diagram of the above moves after kingside castling:
        </p>
        <img class="image" src="Castling2.png">
        <p>
            The same rules that we have covered so far for kingside castling apply to queenside castling. In the diagram 
            below, we can see that no pieces are between the white king on e1 and the white rook on a1 (and neither the 
            king nor rook has moved):
        </p>
        <img class="image" src="Castling3.png">
        <p>
            So how do we castle queenside? We still move the king over two squares (this time from e1 to c1), and then 
            the rook moves from a1 to d1. Here is a diagram of the above moves after queenside castling:
        </p>
        <img class="image" src="Castling4.png">
        <h2>Other rules of Castling</h2>
        <p>
            Sometimes the first two conditions (no pieces are between the king and rook, and neither the king nor rook 
            has been moved) are satisfied, but we are still unable to castle. Here are three additional rules of castling:
            <br>
            1) If you are in check, you cannot castle. You must first get out of check before you can do anything. In the 
            diagram below, the bishop on b4 puts the white king is in check, so White is unable to castle.
        </p>
        <img class="image" src="NoCastle1.png">
        <p>
            2) You cannot castle if any square the king is moving through is attacked by your opponent's pieces. In the 
            diagram below, the white king cannot castle kingside because Black's bishop on a6 attacks the f1-square.
        </p>
        <img class="image" src="NoCastle2.png">
        <p>
            3) You cannot castle into check. This rule is easy to remember, since moving into check is illegal in the 
            first place! In the diagram below, the white king cannot castle because Black's bishop on c5 attacks the g1 square.
        </p>
        <img class="image" src="NoCastle3.png">
        <h2>Why castle?</h2>
        <p>
            Now that you understand how and when you can perform this special move, we can discuss why it is so important. 
            Castling gets your king out of the center and protected by pawns. Castling also lets your rook into the game. In the 
            following position, White has just castled kingside:
        </p>
        <img class="image" src="Castled.png">
        <p>
            Note how White's king is very safe on g1 and is protected by the f2, g2, and h2 pawns. We can also see that castling 
            has connected the white rooks, which can now coordinate better. Getting your king out of the center to safety 
            while also developing a rook is a great two-for-one move! By removing your king from the center, 
            you avoid a lot of quick checkmates!
