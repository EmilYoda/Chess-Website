        <h1>The Rook</h1>
        <p> 
            The rook is considered the second strongest chess piece after the queen. It is worth 5 points. 
            Each player has 2 rooks, they are placed on a1 and h1 for white, a8 and h8 for black.<br>
        </p>
        <h2>How the Rook moves:</h2>

        <p>
            The red squares represent the possible squares a rook can move to. Therefore the rook moves in a straight line
            up, down, left and right. However it becomes limited when a piece is on one of those squares. Let's look at the 
            picture bellow:

            The green squares represent the possible squares the rook can move to. As you can see the rook cannot go beyond 
            a piece and therefore cannot jump over pieces. In the example you notice that the square the bishop is on is 
            colored green meaning the rook can captures the bishop. However the square where the pawn stands is not colored 
            green meaning you cannot move there as it is occupied by one of your pieces or that would mean capturing it. 
            <br><br>
            The rook takes part in a special move called <a href="king.html" style="color: #7a7a7a;">castling</a> which is explained in the section of the tutorial that covers 
            how the King moves.
