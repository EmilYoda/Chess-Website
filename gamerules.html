        <h1>Game Rules</h1>
        <h2>Set up the board</h2>
        <p>
            At the beginning of the game the chessboard is laid out so 
            that each player has the white (or light) color square in the bottom right-hand side.
        </p>

        <p>
            The chess pieces are then arranged the same way each time. The second row (or rank) 
            is filled with pawns. The rooks go in the corners, then the knights next to them, 
            followed by the bishops, and finally the queen, who always goes on her own matching 
            color (white queen on white, black queen on black), and the king on the remaining square.
        </p>
        <h2>Turns</h2>
        <p>
            The player with the white pieces always moves first. Therefore, players generally 
            decide who will get to be white by chance or luck such as flipping a coin or having 
            one player guess the color of the hidden pawn in the other player's hand. White then 
            makes a move, followed by black, then white again, then black, and so on until the end 
            of the game. Being able to move first is a tiny advantage that gives the white player 
            an opportunity to attack right away.
        </p>
        <h2>Draws</h2>
        <p>
            Draws are a big part of chess. From saving you from a lost position to securing first 
            place in a tournament, every player needs to understand how ties happen.
        </p>
        <h2>What Is A Draw In Chess?</h2>
        <p>
            A draw occurs in chess when neither player wins nor losesâ€”the game ends in a tie. Either 
            of the two players can ask for a draw, and after the game is tied, each player wins half a point.
            <br>
            Draws are more common among higher-rated players, but even if you're still a beginner or 
            intermediate player, you should know all the drawing rules so no one catches you by surprise.
        </p>
        <h2>Types Of Draw</h2>
        <p>
            According to the FIDE rules, there are five different scenarios where a game can end in a draw. 
            In most cases, one player has to propose or claim a tie, but in some specific situations, an arbiter 
            may decide to end the game and claim a draw.
        </p>
        <h3>Stalemate</h3>
        <p>
            A draw by stalemate happens when the player who needs to move has no legal moves and his king is not 
            in check (otherwise, that would be a checkmate!). For a stalemate to happen, the move that produced 
            the position has to be legal.
        </p>
        <img class="image" src="stalemate.gif">
        <p>
            Sometimes, grandmasters find creative ways to avoid losing by making use of the stalemate rule. 
            You can see one example of this in the diagram below! In the following game, legendary GM Garry 
            Kasparov playing as Black found a way to draw against GM Anatoly Karpov by taking advantage of the stalemate rule.
        </p>

        <h3>Dead position</h3>
        <p>
            A dead position happens when neither player can legally checkmate the opponent's king. If the game reaches this 
            situation and the move that generated the position is legal, the game ends in a tie.
            <br>
            Look at this example of a dead position:
        </p>
        <img class="image" src="deadpos.png">
        <p>
            One of the most common instances of dead positions is when there is insufficient material for either player to 
            checkmate their opponent. This type of draw can happen even when one of the players runs out of time, provided 
            the other player does not have enough material to deliver checkmate.
            <br>
            Here are the piece combinations that lead to a draw by insufficient material:
        </p>
        <div class="listbox">
            <ul class="list">
                <li>King vs. king</li>
                <li>King and bishop vs. king</li>
                <li>King and knight vs. king</li>
                <li>King and bishop vs. king and bishop <br>of the same color as the opponent's bishop</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
            As you can see, this rule is very generous to the type of checkmates that players can reach. 
            Typically, you would not be able to checkmate your opponent if you had just a king and a bishop. 
            If your opponent has other pieces on the board and blunders, however, their king could be trapped and mated.
            <br>
            This rule led arbiters to award GM Magnus Carlsen with a win and the title in the 2019 World Blitz championship. 
            Some people argue that the game should have ended in a draw since Carlsen had only a piece to fend for himself. 
            But if GM Alireza Firouzja played terribly, he could still be mated by Carlsen.
        </p>
        <h3>Mutual agreement</h3>
        <p>
            If for any reason, both players agree to a draw, the game immediately ends, and both win half a point. For 
            this type of tie to happen, one of the players must propose a draw, and the other player must accept it. 
            If the other player refuses the offer or keeps playing, the game is not tied.
            <br>
            In this game by Carlsen and GM Fabiano Caruana for the last standard time control round of the World Chess 
            Championship in 2018, they both agreed to a draw. This tie led the match to tiebreaks and caused controversy 
            because many people thought Carlsen had good winning chances with more time on the clock.
        </p>
        <img class="image" src="stalemate3.png">
        <h3>Threefold repetition</h3>
        <p>
            A player can ask for a draw when a position is reached (or is about to be reached) at least three times in the 
            same game. This repetition is only possible when all the pieces of the same size and color are occupying 
            identical squares as they were before, and all the possible moves are also the same. As a result, if capturing 
            en passant was previously an option that is no longer available, this position is not considered a repetition.
            <br>
            When a threefold repetition occurs, the game does not necessarily need to end immediately. The game only ends 
            in a draw if the player who has the move requests a tie.
            <br>
            Most commonly, threefold repetitions happen when a player is losing and finds a perpetual check to save his game.
        </p>
        <img class="image" src="threefold.gif">
        <h3>50 move rule</h3>
        <p>
            If both players make 50 consecutive moves without capturing any pieces or moving any pawns, any player can ask for 
            a draw if it is their turn to play. This rule exists to prevent games from prolonging too much when neither player 
            is making any progress.
            <br>
            To make good use of this kind of draw, you need to learn the basic checkmating patterns. Nothing is worse than 
            having enough pieces to checkmate your opponent's lonely king but being unable to do so.
