        <h1>The Pawn</h1>
        <p> 
            The pawn is the least powerful chess piece, but it can be promoted into any 
            other chess piece (except for a king). As Philidor once said, "Pawns are the soul of chess!"
            <br>
            When a game begins, each side starts with eight pawns. The pawns begin the game on the second 
            and seventh rank: White's pawns start on the second rank, while Black's pawns are located on the seventh rank.
        </p>

            A pawn is worth one point. It is considerably less valuable than the other pieces by itself, but in many 
            positions, three pawns are equal to or even stronger than a minor piece (knight or bishop).
        </p>
        <h2>How the Pawn moves:</h2>
        <p>
            As mentioned, the pawn is the least powerful piece. A pawn moves forward one square unless it is that 
            pawn's first move. If it is the pawn's first move, then it can move one or two squares. Please note that 
            if a pawn has already been moved, it can never move two squares again.
        </p>

        <p>
            The pawn can only move forward if it is not blocked by another piece. In the following diagram, the white 
            pawn on the e4-square can't move because it is blocked by the black pawn on the e5-square.
        </p>
        <h2>How The Pawn Captures And En Passant</h2>
        <p>
            The pawn attacks or captures one square diagonally in each direction. In the diagram below, we can see that 
            the pawn on the e4-square attacks the squares d5 and f5.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the following position, the pawn on the e4-square can capture the black pawn on f5 but NOT the pawn on e5.
        </p>
        <img class="image" src="PawnMoves4.png">
        <p>
            There is a special rule in chess regarding pawn captures known as en passant. If a white pawn is on the fifth 
            rank and a black pawn's first move places it directly next to the white pawn, then the white pawn can capture 
            the black pawn as if it moved just one square. This rule also works if a black pawn is on the fourth rank and 
            a white pawn's first move places it directly next to the black pawnâ€”in this case, the black pawn may capture 
            the white pawn as if it moved just one square (but only for this move)!
            <br>
            In the following diagram, Black has just played e7-e5. Since the black pawn moved two squares on its first 
            move and because it is directly next to the white pawn on d5, White can capture the e-pawn with dxe6 (but only 
            for one move).
        </p>

        <h2>Promotion</h2>
        <p>
            So far the pawn doesn't seem too powerful, right? Well, pawns have the unique ability to be able to promote 
            into a knight, bishop, rook or queen! If a white pawn reaches the eighth rank or if a black pawn reaches the 
            first rank, then that pawn gets promoted. It is up to the player who is promoting a pawn to decide which piece 
            they are promoting to, although most of the time promoting to a queen is the desirable choice.
            <br>
            In the image below, we can see that moving the a7-pawn to a8 results in promotion! Promoting to a queen 
            (or a rook) will lead to checkmate!
        </p>

        <p>
            In rare instances, underpromotion is best. Underpromotion occurs when a pawn is promoted to a knight, 
            bishop, or rook instead of a queen. In the following position, underpromoting to a knight is the best 
            move because it creates a checkmate!
