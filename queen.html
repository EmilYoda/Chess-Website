        <h1>The Queen</h1>
        <p> 
            The queen is the most powerful of all of the chess pieces and is often used in early and brutal attacks. It is 
            important to learn how to make your opponent fear your dangerous queen!
        </p>
        <h2>How the Queen moves:</h2>
        <p>
            As mentioned, the queen is the most powerful piece. This is because the queen can attack (or defend) more squares 
            than any other piece!
            <br>
            The queen moves similarly to multiple pieces. It can move in any direction like a king (but the queen is not limited 
            to a single square). The queen can move the same way a rook can, moving freely up and down on any file and left and 
            right on any rank.
        </p>

            The queen can also move freely on any diagonal like a bishop.
        </p>

        <p>
            The queen can move as many squares as it likes as long as it is not blocked by another piece or occupied square. 
            The queen can capture an enemy piece by moving to the occupied square.
            <br>
            One easy way to remember how the queen moves is that it moves like a rook and bishop combined.
