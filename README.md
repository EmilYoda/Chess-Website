There are a lot of images and backgrounds included, along with the modules mentioned above. 
For the website to function properly, you need to include all the images, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. 
I have removed the background video from the main page because it was over 100MB. 
Please feel free to replace it with any video/image of your choice.
